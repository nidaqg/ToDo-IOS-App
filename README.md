## Description
a simple to-do app for ios created using react-native

## User Story

As a user I want to be able to save multiple to-do lists sorted by list name. I can add and delete entire to-do lists as well as adding and deleting individual items in the lists.

## Installation


## Usage

When the user opens the app, they are presented with the homepage where they can press the add button to start adding lists. Once they have added a list, they can click on it to go to the list page and start adding individual items to the list. When done with a task, the user can mark it as done and it will be deleted. The user can also click the x button on each list on the homepage to delete entire lists.
